## About

Hi. I am Nuriddin Kamardinov, a Web Developer at <a href="https://revolution.uz">Revolution Group</a> and Co-founder at <a href="https://effort.uz">Effort.uz</a>, from Andijan, Uzbekistan. I aim to make a positive difference in the world.

    I write <a href="https://medium.com/@falconur" target="_blank">IT-blogs</a> in Uzbek to create more qualitative content for Uzbek learners and manage <a href="https://t.me/event_uz" target="_blank">Telegram channel</a>, which announces different events. Additionally, keen on reading books, love travelling, but not good at playing chess :)

## About

Hi. I am Nuriddin Kamardinov, a freelance Web Developer from Andijan, Uzbekistan. I aim to make a positive difference in the world.

    I write <a href="https://medium.com/@falconur" target="_blank">IT-blogs</a> in Uzbek to create more qualitative content for Uzbek learners. Additionally, keen on reading books, love travelling, but not good at playing soccer :)
